## Running app
- install all required packages by running:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

- set application environment to desired one, environment name should match one of the files in `/config` directory.
   >This step requires repeating when PC was rebooted or command prompt restarted.

    Unix Bash (Linux, Mac, etc.):
    ```
    $ export APP_CONFIG_FILE=local
    $ export FLASK_ENV=local
    $ export FLASK_APP=local
    ```

    Windows CMD:
    ```
    set APP_CONFIG_FILE=local
    set FLASK_ENV=local
    set FLASK_APP=local
    ```

    Windows PowerShell:
    ```
    $env:APP_CONFIG_FILE="local"
    $env:FLASK_ENV = "local"
    $env:FLASK_APP = "nisse"
    ```

- create configuration file in `/config` directory matching your APP_CONFIG_FILE environment variable.
    Eg. if you executed command
    ```
    $env:APP_CONFIG_FILE = "development" 
    ```

    you should have a file named `development.py` in your `/config` directory. Within this file you should define connection string, database port and SQLAlchemy orm tracking setting using following manner:
    ```
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'mysql+pymysql://root:password@localhost/nisse_db'
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_PORT = 3306
    SQLALCHEMY_TRACK_MODIFICATIONS = False
    ```
- create empty database named `nisse_db` - this is required, otherwise application won't start
- migrate database to latest version.

     to check if database is up to date run
     ```
     flask db current
     ```
     This command should output something like: migration_hash (head) if database is up to date. 
     ```
     dbc11c363b7f (head)
     ```
    
    To migrate database to latest version, execute:
    ```
    flask db upgrade
    ```
- to run application just execute following command:

    Unix Bash (Linux, Mac, etc.):
    ```
    $ flask run    
    ```

    Windows CMD or PowerShell:
    ```
    flask run    
    ```

    if required, multiple parameters are available to pass when running application:
    ```
    flask run -h localhost -p 5002 
    ```
    above command will run app instance on localhost on port 5002.


### Migrations
Performing migrations is limited to a few CLI command.
Make changes to the database model, and then just run command to create migration file: 
```
flask db migrate -m your_migration_name
```
After migrating database, generated migration file MUST BE reviewed as the auto-gen tool has limitations when detecting changes.

Here is full list of migration limitations:

Besides of review, ALWAYS test downgrade operation on your local machine, this will prevent potential problems when downgrading migrations.

Remember, -m parameter is not required, but it is good to give a migration some title which make it easier to know what particular migration actually does.

#### Potential pitfalls detected during migrations development
> This list should be constantly expaned while gaining more and more experience with flask migrations.

- when new foreign key constraint is created, ALWAYS add it appropriate name instead of python `None` - this will allow seamless downgrade operation
    migration operation generated like this:
    ```
    op.create_foreign_key(None, 'time_entries', 'users', ['user_id'], ['user_id'])
    ```
    should be changed to this:
    ```
    op.create_foreign_key('fk_timeentries_user', 'time_entries', 'users', ['user_id'], ['user_id'])
    ```


To actually perfrom migration on database, execute: 
```
flask db upgrade
```

### Package management
When new package is installed and it is required by application, it should be added to `requirements.txt` file, so other developers could simply 
install new packages by running command: 
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
